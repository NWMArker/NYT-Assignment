# NYT-Assignment

This assignment was to build a application utilizing the New York Times API. The objective was to build an application that would populate with articles from the NYT archives. My application includes urls to access the arcticles, key search terms, and images that coincide with each article. I've also included pagination to toggle through multiple pages of articles.
